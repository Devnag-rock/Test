-> For creating blank theme from locally below things I followed
-> In the local system I created one folder and in that I added same folder which is required for make a Shopify theme. 
-> Then I added the basic files folder wise. 
-> In the layout folder I added 2 blank files called theme.liqiod and passwor.liquid
-> In the tempplate folder I added 2 default files gift_card.liquid and index.json file 
-> I created the one custom section file called image-banner-2.liquid file. This is the just for enable home page and remove 404 error. 
-> Now I called this section file into index.json file.
-> Then I created 2 filles into Config folder called settings_data.json and settings_schema.json 
-> in the settings_schema.json file I added the theme information. (Which is dummy).
-> Then I make the ZIP file of this folder and uploaded into one of the development store. 
-> Once that done, using the ThemeKit I clone that same theme in my local system again and make the file changes as per the task and push the changes into store
