1. For creating blank theme from locally below things I followed
2. In the local system I created one folder and in that I added same folder which is required for make a Shopify theme. 
3. Then I added the basic files folder wise. 
4. In the layout folder I added 2 blank files called theme.liqiod and passwor.liquid
5. In the tempplate folder I added 2 default files gift_card.liquid and index.json file 
6. I created the one custom section file called image-banner-2.liquid file. This is the just for enable home page and remove 404 error. 
7. Now I called this section file into index.json file.
8. Then I created 2 filles into Config folder called settings_data.json and settings_schema.json 
9. in the settings_schema.json file I added the theme information. (Which is dummy).
10. Then I make the ZIP file of this folder and uploaded into one of the development store. 
11. Once that done, using the ThemeKit I clone that same theme in my local system again and make the file changes as per the task and push the changes into store
